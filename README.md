---

### 9. **A Postgres query is running slower than expected. Explain your approach to troubleshooting it.**

#### **Approach**
1. **Review Locking and Contention**:
   - Use `pg_stat_activity` to identify locking or contention:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
     ```

2. **Analyze Query Execution**:
   - Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand query execution plans:
     ```sql
     EXPLAIN ANALYZE <your_query>;
     ```

3. **Check Indexes**:
   - Ensure important fields are properly indexed:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
     ```

4. **Optimize Database Configuration**:
   - **Memory Settings**: Ensure sufficient memory is allocated for query execution (e.g., `work_mem`).
   - **Autovacuum**: Tune autovacuum settings to avoid bloated tables.
   - **Connection Settings**: Verify configurations like `max_connections` and `shared_buffers`.

5. **Denormalization (if needed)**:
   - Simplify data structures for faster query access where appropriate.

6. **Test and Verify**:
   - Re-run the query to check for improvements.
   - Escalate to developers or database administrators if necessary and provide recommendations.

## Section 3: Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### 11. **How would you set up monitoring for the React Native mobile appâ€™s API endpoints?**

#### **Implementation**
1. **End-to-End Monitoring**:
   - Use **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)** tools like **Datadog**, **New Relic**, or **Dynatrace** to monitor:
     - API performance
     - User interactions
     - Network request timings

2. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - Integrate tools like **Jaeger** or **OpenTelemetry** to trace API requests from the app to the backend and database services.

3. **Alerting**:
   - Use **AWS CloudWatch**, **Slack**, or **PagerDuty** to set up alerts based on predefined thresholds.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Build dashboards using tools like **Grafana**, Kubernetes Dashboard, or Lens.

5. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Aggregate logs from the React Native app and backend APIs using tools like:
     - **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
     - **Fluentd** + **Grafana Loki**

### 12. **Explain how you would debug high latency in Node.js microservices.**

#### **Approach**
1. **Establish Observability**:
   - **Distributed Tracing**:
     - Use tools like **Jaeger** or **OpenTelemetry** to trace requests across the microservices architecture.
     - Identify latency points (e.g., services, databases, or external APIs).
   - **Key Metrics Monitoring**:
     - Use **Prometheus + Grafana** or **Datadog** to track:
       - Response time (P50, P90, P99 latency)
       - Error rates
       - CPU, memory, and I/O usage for each Node.js service

2. **Analyze Infrastructure and Network**:
   - Inspect network latency and bandwidth using tools like `ping` or `traceroute`.
   - Use Kubernetes metrics to verify resource utilization:
     ```bash
     kubectl top nodes
     kubectl top pods
     ```
   - Check container resource limits and throttling.

3. **Automation and Documentation**:
   - Add continuous profiling and automated anomaly detection in production environments.
   - Maintain detailed runbooks for quick resolution of similar issues.

## Section 4: Behavioral

### 13. **Describe a time you improved the performance of an infrastructure system. What challenges did you face?**

#### **Scenario**
In a previous role, I addressed performance issues in a Kubernetes production cluster that experienced high latency and frequent pod evictions.

#### **Challenges**
- **Node Resource Fragmentation**: Inefficient pod scheduling.
- **Network Policies**: Poor configurations increased latency.
- **Pod Resource Requests/Limits**: Suboptimal configurations caused instability.
- **Monitoring**: Lack of proper metrics for cluster health.

#### **Solutions**
1. **Cluster Optimization**:
   - Implemented **cluster-autoscaler** with custom scaling policies.
   - Configured **Pod Disruption Budgets** to maintain service availability.
2. **Resource Management**:
   - Used **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** to dynamically adjust pod resources.
   - Configured custom scheduling policies with pod affinity/anti-affinity.
   - Implemented proper QoS classes for critical workloads.
3. **Monitoring Enhancements**:
   - Deployed **Prometheus** with custom alerts for cluster health.
   - Built **Grafana dashboards** for real-time visibility.
   - Integrated **kube-state-metrics** for detailed insights.

#### **Results**
- Reduced pod scheduling latency by **60%**.

### 14. **How do you prioritize tasks when multiple urgent issues arise?**

#### **Approach**
1. **Assess Impact**:
   - Determine the number of affected users.
   - Identify business-critical services that are down.
   - Evaluate revenue impact.

2. **Take Action**:
   - Focus on resolving the most critical issue first.
   - Track and communicate the status of other issues.
   - Leverage runbooks for faster resolutions.
   - Delegate less critical tasks to teammates when appropriate.

3. **Communication**:
   - Keep stakeholders informed about progress.
   - Clearly state which issues are being addressed and which require assistance.
   - Document steps for future reference.

4. **Follow-Up**:
   - Review resolved incidents and update documentation.
   - Share learnings with the team.
   - Implement preventive measures to avoid similar problems.

#### **Example**
While monitoring systems, I encountered multiple alerts:
- The main application was running slow (critical customer impact).
- An overnight backup failed.
- The development team couldnâ€™t access the test environment.

**Resolution**:
- Focused on resolving the slow application issue first as it affected customers.
- Communicated the backup failure and test environment issue to appropriate teams for planning resolution.
- Documented all actions and updated stakeholders on progress.
